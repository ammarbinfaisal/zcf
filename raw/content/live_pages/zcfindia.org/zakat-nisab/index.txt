What is Zakat & Nisab
What is Zakat?
Zakat
is
not
an
arbitrary
handout
or
imposed
tax.
Zakat
is
not
a
means
to
be
generous
–
it
is
what
Allah
has
ordained
for
us
–
it
is
a
duty
. In order to promote financial and spiritual reform, eradicate greed, and solidify the Islamic economy—all of which will contribute to the stability and prosperity of Muslims—Zakat has been established as one of the pillars of Islam.
According to the Qur’an : Zakat is a way to obtain Allah’s mercy.
Zakat
is
the
fourth
pillar
of
Islam,
after
Salat
and
Som.
Muslims
possess
a
specified
minimum
amount
of
wealth
(called
nisab)
for
the
entire
yearly
cycle
and
are
required
to
pay
Z
akat
for
prayers.

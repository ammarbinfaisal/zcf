Mobile Clinic
Goals & Objectives
Despite many efforts to improve access to quality health care, our city faces many challenges like increasing costs, negligible awareness about basic health regime and high rates of chronic disease. People who are most affected by it are the ones with low income, people who belong to rural communities.
Identify neighborhoods where residents have a lack of access to healthcare.
Provide disease prevention services with community partners.
Provide primary medical care counseling and services at no cost to all individuals regardless of their caste, sex, and religion.
Mission
The mission of the Mobile Clinic is to reduce health disparities by providing best practice, flexible, low-barrier primary care at no cost to individuals, who are unable to access the healthcare system.
Vision
To create health program that creates a systematic approach equipping individuals and groups as advocates of health. Mobile health clinics will play an important role especially among vulnerable populations, in rural communities without easy access to healthcare facilities. For some people, mobile health clinics are the only means to lifesaving medical treatment and access to affordable health.

What is Zakat & Nisab
What is Zakat?
Zakat
is
not
an
arbitrary
handout
or
imposed
tax.
Zakat
is
not
a
means
to
be
generous
–
it
is
what
Allah
has
ordained
for
us
–
it
is
a
duty
. In order to promote financial and spiritual reform, eradicate greed, and solidify the Islamic economy—all of which will contribute to the stability and prosperity of Muslims—Zakat has been established as one of the pillars of Islam.
According to the Qur’an : Zakat is a way to obtain Allah’s mercy.
Zakat
is
the
fourth
pillar
of
Islam,
after
Salat
and
Som.
Muslims
possess
a
specified
minimum
amount
of
wealth
(called
nisab)
for
the
entire
yearly
cycle
and
are
required
to
pay
Z
akat
for
prayers.
What is Nisab?
What
is
the
Nisab
threshold?
The
Zakat
Nisab
value
is
the
minimum
threshold
required
of
a
person
eligible
to
pay
Zakat
in
that
particular
year.
To
be
eligible
to
pay
zakat, One must have nisab value equal to or greater than in your overall wealth , which is defined as the equivalent of:
Either 87.48 grammes (7.5 tola) of gold or, 612.36 grammes (52.5 tola) of silver.
Who is eligible to receive Zakat?
1. The Poor (al-fuqara) means low income or extreme poverty.
2. The Needy (al-masâkîn) means a person in need.
3. Those Employed to Administer of the zakat.
4. People whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth).
5. People in bondage (slaves and captives).
6. The Obligated.
7. In the cause of Allah.
